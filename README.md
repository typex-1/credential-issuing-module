## Quick start using Docker

### Get the image

1. First ensure you have Docker installed. [See Docker installation help](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

2. From a command line below, build your Docker container:

    docker pull awathcsea/blindca.
    ```

    This image will expose 8081 inside the container and receive web requests, passing different requests to issuing service.

### Run the Docker

   
    docker run -t -i -p 8080:8080 aowatchsea/blindca.
